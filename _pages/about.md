I have started my professional path as **Mechatronics engineer**, continued as **FPGA programmer** and ended up as a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering where I worked on **diagnostics of photovoltaic devices**. My path may seem chaotic to an outsider, but from my experience, I have accumulated robust technical knowledge stemming from **mathematics/mechanics/electronics**, continued by fundamental understanding of modern **silicon devices (FPGA/CPU/GPU)** to obtaining a deep but high-level view of exploding **field on Renewable Energy**, where I acquired a strong passion for **machine learning and data analytics**. Interested reader may check my publications and my repositories, which are the amalgamation of my work over the course of my studies.
