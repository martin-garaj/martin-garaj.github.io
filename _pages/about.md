My personal website integrated with Github
======


I have started my professional path as a **mechatronics engineer**, progressed to an **FPGA programmer** and ended up as a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering where I worked on **diagnostics of photovoltaic devices**. My path may seem diverse, but I have build my knowledge on my passion for engineering, stemming from **mathematics/mechanics/electronics**, followed by fundamental understanding of modern **silicon devices (FPGA/CPU/GPU)** to a deep understanding of **renewable energy**. My Ph.D. studies flared up my interest in **machine learning and data analytics**. Interested reader may check my publications and my Github repositories, which are the amalgamation of my work over the course of my studies.
