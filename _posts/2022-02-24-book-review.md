Virtually every proper university course relies on teaching convex optimization using this book. 
Despite that, it is not an easy book for a self-study. I have been through this book with the help 
of Prof. Chuan WU from Hong Kong University, lecturer and course leader for convex optimizatio course. 
The course generally covered the chapter 3, 4, 5, 9, 10 and 11.

### Strengths
1. Covering introductory and advanced concepts
2. Well structured (easy to navigate and easy to use as a reference book)
3. Reader-friendly mathematical notation

### Weaknesses
1. The book is not necessarily beginner-friendly for self-study audience
