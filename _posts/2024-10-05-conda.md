## Card-box for 67x91 [mm] cards

I found myself in a need for particularly sized box, after I put sleeves on 
my set of Exploding Kittens (Party version). Sleeves, especially with 
non-transparent backside, may add significant volume to cards. The extra 
volume caused the original Exploding Kitten box to explode, which prompt me 
to come up with more permanent solution.

Thus I opened my trusty SolidWorks and designed one on my own, with lock-in 
separators and magnetic tops, that *click* into place.

The inner dimensions of the box are depicted below.
