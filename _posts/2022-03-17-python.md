Previously in the post about [Python code: Nested dictionary with lambda functions](http://martin-garaj.github.io/posts/2022/02/27/code/) the nested 
dictionary was introduced, such that no prior knoedge of keys is required, only the number 
of levels.

This post extends the previous post for a specific, but quite common user-oriented example.

**Motivation:**
Lets have a user interacting with a graph. Graphs are  usually built from data and stored as
adjancency matrix. But what is the graph is too sparse and there are no data, only the users 
input?

In such case, the interaction of the user with the graph is easier through a list representation
of the graph. Rather than a large matrix, the list stores only the vertices and edges. From the 
user perspective, the ideally simplified input requires only a pairs of nodes, which are connected
by a vertex.

```python
user_input = [	[1,2], # vertex between node #1 and node #2
		[2,3], # vertex between node #2 and node #3
		[3,1]] # vertex between node #3 and node #1
```

Notice, the user specifies the existance of the edge with single direction only and requiring the 
user to specify the other direction is error-prone and essentially doubles the work on the user side.


**Question:**
How to translate the `user_input` into a list representation of bidirectional graph?

```python
from collections import defaultdict
# two levels deep nested dictionary with empty list at the end
graph_list = defaultdict( list )

for edge in user_input:
	node_0 = edge[0]
	node_1 = edge[1]
	# define bidirectional edge as 2 opposing unidirectional
	graph_list[node_0].append(node_1) # unidirectional edge
	graph_list[node_1].append(node_0) # unidirectional edge
```

Lets see the output using `pretty()` defined in the previous [post](http://martin-garaj.github.io/posts/2022/02/27/code/),
which yields the following list representation of bidirectional graph:


```console
1
	[2, 3]
2
	[1, 3]
3
	[2, 1]
```
