[Book available here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf)

This is a staple material for studying ML. The mathematical notation, illustrations and friendly appraoch is excellent for people studying ML. 
I was lucky to have [Prof. Antoni Bert CHAN](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=j4vFSn8AAAAJ) as my tutor who made reading the book 
an enjoyable experience. I have covered chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 and 13.


### Strengths
1. Gentle to ML newcommers in terms of mathematical notation and the level of detail
2. Covers wide spectrum of ML techniques
3. Perfect for self-study


### Weaknesses
1. The book could be longer :(

### Conclusion
A must-have for anyone that wants to get into ML.
