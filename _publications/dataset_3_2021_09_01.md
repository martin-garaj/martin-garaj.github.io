A well curated dataset of more than **900** unique I-V characteristics (accompanied by Electroluminecsent images) of PV cells in reference and degraded state (cracks, interconnect failures and polarized/shunt Potential-Induced-Degradation). The dataset is available through [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/vxj8bkkfkg).

The following figure illustrates the cross-section of manufactured single-cell laminates:

The I-V characteristics were measured by a custom measurement hardware, control software is available in [PV-4-wire repository](https://github.com/martin-garaj/PV-4-wire).

Documents describing the dataset and the measurement setup will be available after publication.
