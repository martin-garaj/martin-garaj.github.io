**Abstract**:

An online diagnostic module for condition monitoring of two series-connected photovoltaic 
panels is presented. The technique is based on firstly perturbing the terminal voltages 
and currents of the panels with a switched-inductor circuit, which can also be used for 
differential power processing, to obtain the large-signal dynamic current-voltage 
characteristics of the panels. An evolutionary algorithm is used to estimate the 
intrinsic parameters of the panels from the time series of the sampled panel current 
and voltage. The conditions of the panels are monitored by observing the long-term 
changes in the extracted intrinsic parameters. Prototype data acquisition module for 
studying the conditions of solar panels of different technologies (amorphous and 
crystalline silicon) with different degrees of damage has been built and evaluated. 
Results reveal that the estimated intrinsic parameters from large-signal dynamic 
characteristic correlate with the observed health status of the tested panels. 
Theoretical predictions are favorably compared with experimental measurements.
