**Abstract**:

A new model of photovoltaic (PV) panel is proposed. The model precisely replicates sub-cell level degradation, 
such as cracks and interconnect failures, and reproduces their effect at the panel level I–V characteristic. 
Moreover, a regression method is proposed, which infers the model’s parameters from combination of 
electroluminescent (EL) image and degraded I–V characteristic. The combination of quantitative (EL image) and 
qualitative (I–V characteristic) enables to characterize the degradation of the cells embedded in the PV panel, 
without physical access to the cells. The proposed model and the regression problem is experimentally verified 
on a set of 3 single cell measurements and a set of 4 crystalline PV panels with various levels of degradation.
